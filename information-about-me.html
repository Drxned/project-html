        <h2>Why I decided to become a programmer?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text-aboutme">
        <p> I decided to become a programmer because this profession was interested in me. Since childhood, 
           I've been fond of spending a lot of time with a computer. Then I became interested in what are the 
           professions associated with the computer.</p> 
        <p> And then I decided to go to the programming courses to learn more about this profession. 
           We have taught only the beginning of html for half a year, and I decided that I will not go on these courses, 
           but I liked programming. Then I went to college and now I'm studying there.</p>
